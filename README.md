## About us:

Maris works as a data entry specialist. She can't wait to change her career to IT. At the moment, she prefers Python to Java(it changes depending on the week). 

Svetlana works as a physical therapist but wants to change her career and start working in the IT field. It is not easy for me to study in this programming course, but I am putting in all my effort. By next year, I hope to find a new job in IT.
